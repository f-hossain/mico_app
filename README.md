# MICO iPhone Application

This is an iOS application coded with Swift 5 and Xcode 12 using the Apple Core Bluetooth and AV Foundation frameworks. This app:
- scans and connects to peripheral devices; specifically the MICO wireless flash device designed by our UW FYDP team. 
- takes and automatically saves photos to your camera roll, seamlessly integrating the wireless device's flash with the moment the photo is taken for well-lit, high quality photos.
